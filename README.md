# EXIF Frame Card

A lightweight desktop app for turning photos into styled EXIF frame cards.

The app reads photo metadata, renders a selected visual template, and exports a finished JPG or PNG. It is designed for local photo testing and small batch workflows.

## Features

- Import photos by file picker, folder picker, drag and drop.
- Show imported photos as a thumbnail list.
- Read common EXIF fields: camera, lens, focal length, aperture, shutter, ISO, date, and GPS when available.
- Manually edit displayed metadata per photo.
- Optional batch edit mode for applying visual settings across imported photos.
- Local EXIF and preview caching for faster switching between images.
- Responsive preview with scroll-wheel zoom and drag-to-pan viewing.
- Export JPG or PNG with selectable long-edge resolution, including original size.
- Camera brand logos from local assets, including Sony, Ricoh, and Apple.
- GPS QR code links for Apple Maps, Google Maps, or a universal geo URL.
- Template-specific controls are shown only when the selected template uses them.

## Templates

| Template | Style |
| --- | --- |
| Museum White | Warm museum mat with generous white space and refined EXIF text. |
| Gallery Black | Dark gallery wall look with quiet light typography. |
| Off-white Archive | Archival paper style with title, location, date, and EXIF details. |
| Minimal Border | Clean social-post frame with compact metadata. |
| Vintage Postcard | Warm postcard paper, Dancing Script header text, movable postmark, address lines, logo, and map QR. |
| Color Reversal Film | Medium-format 120 reversal film border with subtle black frame texture and bright yellow EXIF markings. |
